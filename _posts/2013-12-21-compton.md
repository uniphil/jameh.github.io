title: Compton Composite Engine

#My Compton command:
Compton is my compositor of choice. It adds simple elegance to a window manager like Openbox.

```bash
compton -cCGbz --config /dev/null --shadow-exclude 'override_redirect \
|| class_g = "Synapse"' --backend glx
```

Breakdown of options:

`-c`: Enables shadows on windows (note that windows with `_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DESKTOP`
never get shadow)

`-C`: Avoid drawing shadows on dock/panel windows (works on Tint2).

`-G`: Don't draw shadows on drag-and-drop windows. (This means all text, file
dragging - they look rather silly without this option)

`-b`: Daemonize process. (Fork to background process). This is useful when you run
Compton from a script you don't want halted.

`-z`: This clears the drop-shadow from behind windows, so that the only shadow is on the exterior edge. The difference is best explained with a screenshot:

with:

and without:

(see Compton's
[FAQ#6](https://github.com/chjj/compton/wiki/faq "Compton FAQ on Github"))
This matters with transparent or semi-transparent ARGB windows.

`--config /dev/null`:
Points to the configuration file (in my case, I have none, so I point it to
/dev/null).

`--shadow-exclude 'override_redirect || class_g = "Synapse"'`:
Ensures shadows are not drawn on windows of type Override-Redirect, or windows
with class Synapse.
Protip: to find a window's class, or other information use `xwininfo`
