#About
Hi, I'm Jamie. I write mostly about Linux stuff, but this blog might expand to cover stuff like my math studies, general software development.

I'm just about to graduate in May 2014 from [Queen's University](https://queensu.ca) Math and Engineering Computing/Communications option. I've studied Data Compression, Channel Coding, Shannon Information Theory, Signal Processing, Fourier Transforms, Algebraic Stuctures (Group/Number Theory), Probability, Stochastic Processes, Real/Complex Analysis, Control Theory, and will be studying Digital Communication and Control Theory in the Winter.

I'm also proficient at Python coding, and have exposure to Django and Flask (see my [Flask blog site](https://biscuitsandtea.herokuapp.com)). I have experience with C, Java, C++, Matlab.

That said,
